1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
hi everyone i'm arnell and today we're

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,799
going to look at

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
the causative specifically the causative

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
verbs

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,080
have get make and let

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
these look like normal verbs why are

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
they important

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
when we use these verbs in a causative

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
way they have a very

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
unique structure and a special purpose

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
let's take a look here's a basic concept

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,120
of causative verbs you don't do the

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
action

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
someone else does the action but you are

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
in control

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,800
i know this seems a little bit dramatic

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,039
but it's the basic idea

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
so with this idea in mind let's look at

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920
the causative in four steps

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
paying for a service ask convince

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
persuade force and permission

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
we're gonna spend the most time on steps

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,440
one and two

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
with have and get and at the end of this

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,799
lesson

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
i'll have a mini test for you

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
number one paying for a service have

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,880
something

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
plus verb number three get something

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,000
plus

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
verb number three what do i mean by verb

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
number three

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
verb number three is the past participle

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
for example

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,560
play played played eat

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
ate eaten you can see my past participle

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
there

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
okay let's compare

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,799
i iron my shirts every week

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
i have my shirts ironed every week

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
what's the difference the first example

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,079
i do the work the second example

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,040
i pay for this service i don't do the

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,320
work

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,320
i could also say i get my shirts ironed

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
every week have get

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
is there a difference they mean the same

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,679
thing

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,959
have is just slightly more formal get is

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,920
slightly

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,720
less formal let's do another example

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,280
the wind was so strong that a tree

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
branch

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
smashed through my window

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
i repaired my window i had my window

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
repaired

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
i got my window repaired you can see

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
that structure

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
have get something plus verb number

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
three

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,920
i did the work i paid someone else to do

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,319
the work

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
if you're going to if we imagine

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
the causative as a person

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:04,239
it would be miss rich

66
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
i get my nails done every week

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
i'm having my pool clean tomorrow i get

68
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,599
all of my meals cooked

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
by my very own chef foofy and i had our

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,599
portrait painted

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,760
and you can use this structure with any

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,879
tense

73
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
present simple present continuous

74
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,879
past simple you can even use a modal

75
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
verb

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
i might have my boat repainted

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
okay obviously we don't only use a

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,959
causative for big

79
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,640
expensive services for example

80
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
what supermarket do you go to uh

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
i hate food shopping i just order my

82
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,920
groceries online

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,799
and get them delivered groceries are all

84
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
the things you can buy in a supermarket

85
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
groceries groceries hmm

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
what's the difference i had my groceries

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,519
delivered

88
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
i had delivered my groceries are these

89
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
the same thing

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,439
no big difference which one is causative

91
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,920
the first one right have something verb

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
three

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,798
the second example is what we call the

94
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,759
past perfect

95
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,040
tense had plus a verb three

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
so you can see one little change in your

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
word order

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
can make a big difference i have a video

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,199
on the past perfect

100
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
here if you want more information

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
let me know in the comments below the

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,919
last service

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,040
you paid for i had my eyes checked

104
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
recently

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,919
last point in part one because we are

106
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
paying for a service

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
we don't need to say who does the action

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
i get my nails done every week

109
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
done in terms of beauty done means

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,160
styled i get my nails done every week

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
i got my hair done last week

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
i'm getting my makeup done

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,840
i don't need to say buy a nail

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
technician i don't need to say buy a

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
hairdresser

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,320
buy a makeup artist it's always obvious

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
nobody's ever going to think

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
you got your nails done

119
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,360
by a dentist

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,720
okay part two

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
ask persuade convince we're still going

122
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,639
to use

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,039
have and get but the structure changes a

124
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
little bit

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,199
have someone verb one get someone to

126
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
get someone to verb 1.

127
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
in this case we really want to make it

128
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,919
clear

129
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,880
who does the action and in this case

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
we're not necessarily paying for a

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
service

132
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
let's do a few examples

133
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
oh my car has been making this weird

134
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
noise lately

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
really my brother's a mechanic i'll have

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,919
him take a look

137
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,840
have someone verb one

138
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,720
i can't get my six month old son to

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
sleep

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
he never sleeps get someone

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
to verb one

142
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
in this case is there a difference

143
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,960
between have and get

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
yes a little difference for

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
you which example feels more

146
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,880
difficult for the subject

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
when we use get someone to do something

148
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
we often have to persuade or convince

149
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,919
this person

150
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,199
have is a little bit more neutral i have

151
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
my students put their homework on my

152
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,440
desk

153
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
before the lesson starts

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,599
how do you get your students to listen

155
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
to you

156
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
the first one i ask my students to do

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
this

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
they do it so i don't have to the

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
second one how can i convince them

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,120
do you have any tricks or techniques

161
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,599
i'll have my lawyer give you a call he

162
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
might be able to give you some advice

163
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
i'll ask him to call you

164
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,840
getting my parents to agree with me is

165
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
almost impossible

166
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
i can't convince them it's very hard to

167
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
persuade them

168
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
okay so it's important to know this

169
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
difference

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
but yes sometimes we can use these

171
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,800
structures

172
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,110
interchangeably

173
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,800
[Music]

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
i hope everyone enjoyed my presentation

175
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
are there any questions

176
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
yeah um could i please have a printed

177
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,800
version of the presentation

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
of course i'll have sam print you a copy

179
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,599
i'll get sam to print you a copy

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
imagine sam is my assistant

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,520
in this case you can see there really

182
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
isn't any difference

183
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
so it's good to have that feeling but

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
sometimes they can be

185
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,479
interchangeable mini review have

186
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,199
something

187
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,560
verb three get something verb three

188
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
yes they mean the same thing but get is

189
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,919
a little bit

190
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,120
less formal more conversational

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,159
have someone verb one get someone to

192
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,000
verb one they can mean the same thing

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
but get has that stronger feeling of

194
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
needing to convince or persuade someone

195
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
okay let's move on to make

196
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
and lead part three

197
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,800
make someone verb one when we use

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,839
make someone do something we're really

199
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,640
thinking about

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
forcing someone

201
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
and yes there are different levels of

202
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
force

203
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,160
we have physical force

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,279
mental emotional force and then

205
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,200
neutral the robbers

206
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
made the security guard give them the

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
code

208
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,800
did the security guard have a choice no

209
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,290
the robbers made him do it

210
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,279
[Music]

211
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,240
sometimes my boss makes us work late on

212
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
fridays

213
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,959
do we have a choice not really but this

214
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,360
isn't

215
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
exactly physical force is it

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,279
stop making me laugh do i have a choice

217
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,120
no you're so funny i can't stop laughing

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
can you give me an example in the

219
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
comments below using make

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
my kids make me cut the crusts

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,000
off of their sandwiches

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
last one let we're almost done

223
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
let someone do something we're giving

224
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,680
someone permission

225
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,640
we're giving someone a choice and

226
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,279
remember

227
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,480
let is an irregular verb let

228
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
let let all the forms are the same

229
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
my professor let us use our phones

230
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
during the test

231
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
did our professor force us to use our

232
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
phones

233
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
no did we have a choice yes

234
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,680
if you wanted to you could use your

235
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
phone if not that's also fine

236
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
my sister lets me borrow her car

237
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,320
whenever i need it

238
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
does she force me to borrow her car no

239
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
do i have a choice absolutely if i need

240
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
her car

241
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
i have permission and of course in the

242
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
negative

243
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
this means no permission my landlord

244
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
won't let me have a pet in the apartment

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
do i have a choice

246
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,440
no i don't have permission i cannot have

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
a pet

248
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,760
and let isn't only about permission for

249
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,720
people

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
it can also mean to allow something to

251
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
happen

252
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
when you open a bottle of wine let it

253
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
breathe

254
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,940
for 30 minutes before drinking

255
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,480
[Music]

256
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,399
this allows the wine to breathe

257
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
okay let's do a mini test

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,440
number one i hmm next week

259
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
a i'm getting my wisdom teeth removed

260
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
next week

261
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
this is a common mistake or a common

262
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
problem with the causative

263
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
a lot of times students understand why

264
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
we need this grammar when we use this

265
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
grammar

266
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
but oftentimes they don't quite get the

267
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
structure right

268
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
so we can't change the word order and we

269
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,200
can't use a different form of the verb

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
by the way wisdom teeth are those big

271
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,800
teeth

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
at the back of your mouth that you get

273
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
when you're an adult and you do need to

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,600
remove them

275
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
sometimes number two

276
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
a new washing machine

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
see i had my landlord buy a new washing

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,839
machine

279
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,720
once again a and b don't work because

280
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
they're not the correct structure

281
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
last one number three my boss hmm

282
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
while i work

283
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,399
b lets me my boss lets me listen to

284
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
music while i work

285
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,680
technically a and c are correct

286
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,880
but they are not really natural right a

287
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,920
my boss makes me listen to music why

288
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,519
would your boss force you to listen to

289
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
music

290
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
my boss gets me to listen to music

291
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,279
again why would your boss need to

292
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
convince you to do that

293
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,639
you either want to or you don't

294
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,320
okay wonderful so

295
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
i hope today's lesson was helpful i hope

296
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
the difference between

297
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
have get let and make i hope the

298
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,480
differences are clear

299
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
you know what your comments always make

300
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
me smile

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
so leave me one down below i can't wait

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
to see you soon

303
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,839
thank you bye
